# Test 2

## Getting a bit fancier
1. Created a function to handle our crawl. 
2. Specified parameters so we dont crawl too much. We will enhance this as we progeress
3. Created meaningfull error message if we do not have enough credits to run our crawl
4. Output some basic information on the crawl
    * How many pages were crawled?
    * Did the crawl succeed?
    * How many tokens were used?
5. Display the extracted content. This is not pretty, just
   a bunch of text scrolling up the screen up the screen.
   We will make this prettier in another example
