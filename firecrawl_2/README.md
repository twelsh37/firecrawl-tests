# Test 2 - Getting a bit fancier

In this example we build on our previous example in Firecrawl_1.
Here we bring in subjects like paramaters and error handling

## Building on our previous example in Firecrawl_1
1. Import warnings and setup a filter to ignore UserWarnings
2. Created a function to handle our crawl. 
3. Specified parameters so we dont crawl too much. We will enhance this as we progress
4. Created meaningfull error message if we do not have enough credits to run our crawl
5. Output some basic information on the crawl
    * How many pages were crawled?
    * Did the crawl succeed?
    * How many tokens were used?
5. Display the extracted markdown text.
